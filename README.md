# auto_rock_paper_scissor
A simple zero-player rock-paper-scissors game.

The way the game progresses is that in each evolution and for each house, neighbors of the same house are found and one of them is randomly selected and they compete with each other, and if one of them wins, the loser's house is similar to The house wins.

For example, if one house is scissors and another house is paper and they compete with each other, the house that is paper becomes scissors.

This process continues until one of the characters (rock, paper, scissors) fills the entire screen.

**Of course, it is possible that the game will reach a stage where the program will run forever and no result will be displayed.**
